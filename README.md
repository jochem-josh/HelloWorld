# HelloWorld

The purpose of this project was to create a random melody generator.
The generator takes song length, key, starting note, and tempo as input from the user.
The program then generates a random melody from the input that conforms with standard music theory rules.
The program is written in Java

The program is reliant on a package developed by Mobileer Inc. called JSyn. 
This package is used to generate the sound in the program.
